# QtAlienCatcher
This is a Qt/C++ game app where ship should capture aliens in order to maximise the score.

1. Use "Left Arrow" for rotating ship in anticlockwise direction.
2. Use "Right Arrow" for rotating ship in clockwise direction.
3. Use "Up Arrow" for moving forward.
4. Use "Down Arrow" for moving backward.
5. Once ship captures alien, alien is removed and success sound is played.

Enjoy :smiley:
